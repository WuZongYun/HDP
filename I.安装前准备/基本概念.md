## 3. 基本概念

在安装HDP之前，你需要对一下信息有所了解。

* The fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\) of each host in your system. The Ambari install wizard supports using IP addresses. You can use`hostname -f`to check or verify the FQDN of a host.A list of components you want to set up on each host.


* The base directories you want to use as mount points for storing:

  * NameNode data

  * DataNodes data

  * Secondary NameNode data

  * Oozie data

  * YARN data

  * ZooKeeper data, if you install ZooKeeper

  * Various log, pid, and db files, depending on your install type

  |  | You must use base directories that provide persistent storage locations for your HDP components and your Hadoop data. Installing HDP components in locations that may be removed from a host may result in cluster failure or data loss. For example: Do Not use`/tmp`in a base directory path. |
