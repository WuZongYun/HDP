Before deploying an HDP cluster, you should collect the following information:

The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of each host in your system. The Ambari install wizard supports using IP addresses. You can use hostname -f to check or verify the FQDN of a host.

[Note]	Note
Deploying all HDP components on a single host is possible, but is appropriate only for initial evaluation purposes. Typically, you set up at least three hosts; one master host and two slaves, as a minimum cluster.

A list of components you want to set up on each host.

The base directories you want to use as mount points for storing:

NameNode data

DataNodes data

Secondary NameNode data

Oozie data

YARN data

ZooKeeper data, if you install ZooKeeper

Various log, pid, and db files, depending on your install type

[Important]	Important
You must use base directories that provide persistent storage locations for your HDP components and your Hadoop data. Installing HDP components in locations that may be removed from a host may result in cluster failure or data loss. For example: Do Not use /tmp in a base directory path.
