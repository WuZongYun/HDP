###关闭防火墙

For Ambari to communicate during setup with the hosts it deploys to and manages, certain ports must be open and available. The easiest way to do this is to temporarily disable iptables, as follows:

- RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 6



```
service iptables stop
chkconfig iptables off
/etc/init.d/iptables stop
```



- RHEL/CentOS/Oracle Linux 7


```
systemctl disable firewalld
service firewalld stop
```
